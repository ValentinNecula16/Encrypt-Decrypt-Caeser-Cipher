# Encrypt-Decrypt-Caeser-Cipher

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher used for encryption and decryption. The program allows users to either encode or decode a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number.

Features
Encryption: Encrypts your message by shifting each letter by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
Decryption: Decrypts a previously encrypted message by reversing the shift.
Flexible Shift: You can specify how many positions you want to shift the letters (positive or negative).
Handling Non-Alphabetic Characters: Spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphabetic characters are preserved in the output.
